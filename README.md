This is my attempt at an arduino based aquarium controller using  TFT touch screen. It will monitor lights, temperture, 
feeding times and other possibilities as they present themselves. 

equiptment:
  Processor:Arduino Mega 2560
  TFT Screen: Adafruit IlI9341 TFT LCD Shield
  RTC: DS1307
  Onewire Temp Sensor 

This is a work in progress and as of now is not a working model. Touch screen operation is currently about 90% done while signal
output to power relays is about 25% done.
